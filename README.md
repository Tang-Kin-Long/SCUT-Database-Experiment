华南理工大学计算机科学与技术全英班数据库实验  
=
需要设计完整的学生信息管理系统及其UI，工作量相当于一份大作业；  
老师给定的设计需求见"Experiment and design 1-2.doc";  
核心程序为"MIS Program-Tang Kin Long-22计创.py"，可直接运行，也可自行打包生成exe；  
具体操作可以参考Program Manual;  
本项目的DBMS使用轻量的sqlite，数据储存在"experiment_2.db"，请把它与py文件放在同一文件夹下运行；  
希望本项目能为您提供帮助！

This project is the database experiment 2 for UK Computer Science Major in South China University of Technology.  
It needs to design a comprehensive Management Information System and its UI, which is close to a big project.  
"Experiment and design 1-2.doc" is the given design request from teacher.  
"MIS Program-Tang Kin Long-22计创.py" is the core program and you can directly run it or pack it into "exe" file.  
"Program Manual" shows the detail of operations for user to reference.  
The project use slight DBMS "sqlite" and its data is storaged in "experiment_2.db". Please place it in the same file with "py" program.
